Guidance for Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working in this repository.

## Data rule

Read-only server — there is nothing to modify or delete, and no send capability exists. Do not print, log, or commit real message text, contact names, or phone numbers; prefer aggregate/structural queries over selecting rows.

## HARD RULE — LIVE DATA IS THE OWNER'S CALL, NOT YOURS

**By default, tests run against fakes**: in-memory doubles, fixtures, and data invented for
the test. That is what makes the suite repeatable and safe to run unattended. An automated
test exists to catch a breaking change, and it does not need the owner's real data to do
that — so never reach for the real thing out of convenience.

**Debugging is different.** Sometimes the only way to see a real bug is against real data,
and that is a legitimate thing to do here — this rule is not a blanket ban and must not be
read as one. What is forbidden is deciding it alone. However harmless the check looks, the
owner decides whether their own data is touched.

So ask, before doing anything: put an explicit choice to the owner in chat — a question
with options they can pick, not a remark buried in a longer message — stating

1. exactly what you intend to run;
2. exactly which live data it would touch, named rather than summarised;
3. what it would create, change or delete, and whether that is reversible.

If they pick the option that allows it, go ahead and do it. That is a real yes. The
permission covers the run you described — a different check, or a wider one, means a fresh
question. An unrelated "go ahead" earlier in the session is not that consent.

## What this is

A local, read-only MCP server (Swift 6, stdio transport) for WhatsApp. Reads come from `~/Library/Group Containers/group.net.whatsapp.WhatsApp.shared/ChatStorage.sqlite`, opened read-only and immutable. No network, no credential, no cloud API, no outward-facing action of any kind.

Not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to WhatsApp or Meta.

## Commands

```bash
swift build
swift build -c release
swift test
```
